Docs Consolidation
------------------

- Active docs live under `docs/` and in tracked runbooks.
- Historical and WIP material under `docs/LEGACY/` and `WORK-ON-new_docs/` may contain outdated ports and commands.
- Prefer `docs/PORTS_POLICY.md` for authoritative port assignments.

Action items (tracked):
- Migrate relevant how-tos from `WORK-ON-new_docs/` into `docs/` and update port references.
- Remove stale duplicates after migration.
