# Frontend Navigation

The sidebar aggregates navigation items from `baseNav` and `extraNav` in `src/components/navItems.ts`. Items `agent` and `nlp` are behind the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_AGENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_NLP` flags.

Both desktop and mobile menus use the same list. Mobile links close the menu on navigation.
