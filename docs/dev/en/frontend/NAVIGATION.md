# Frontend Navigation

The sidebar is driven by `NAV_ITEMS` in `apps/frontend/src/components/navItems.ts`. The list defines the order: *Agent* follows **Graph**, *NLP* follows **Documents**. Visibility is gated by the `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_AGENT` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_FEATURE_NLP` flags (unset â‡’ enabled in dev).

Both desktop and mobile menus consume the same filtered items and the mobile drawer closes on navigation.

Agent and NLP pages talk to their backends through relative `/api/agent` and `/api/doc-entities` proxies. Override the targets via `NEXT_PROXY_GATEWAY` or `NEXT_PROXY_DOC_ENTITIES` (or `IT_PORT_*`), while `NEXT_PUBLIC_AGENT_API` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOC_ENTITIES_API` are optional.
