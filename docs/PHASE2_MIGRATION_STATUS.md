## Migration Progress Statistics

**Overall Progress:** 9.5% (2/21 services completed)

**By Priority:**
- Critical/High Priority: 40% (2/5 services)
- Medium Priority: 0% (0/6 services)
- Lower Priority: 0% (0/10 services)

**By Complexity:**
- Simple (<10 endpoints): 0% (0/8 services)
- Medium (10-20 endpoints): 10% (1/10 services)
- Complex (20+ endpoints): 0% (0/3 services)

## Expected Timeline

**Week 1 (Current):** Complete 4 high-priority services
- [x] flowise-connector âœ…
- [ ] agent-connector 
- [ ] media-forensics
- [ ] forensics
- [ ] plugin-runner

**Week 2:** Complete 6 medium-priority services
**Week 3:** Complete 7 lower-priority services  
**Week 4:** Complete 3 partial-standard services

**Total Estimated Time:** 4 weeks for complete API standardization

## Quality Metrics Target

**For Each Service:**
- [ ] All endpoints under /v1 namespace
- [ ] StandardError envelope for all errors
- [ ] PaginatedResponse for list endpoints
- [ ] Health/Ready/Info endpoints
- [ ] OpenAPI documentation with examples
- [ ] Backward-compatible legacy endpoints
- [ ] Tests for core functionality

**System-wide:**
- [ ] Port assignments in scripts/patch_ports.sh
- [ ] Docker compose integration
- [ ] CLI command mapping
- [ ] End-to-end workflow testing

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Migrate agent-connector (critical for plugin system)
2. **Short-term:** Complete Week 1 high-priority services
3. **Medium-term:** Phase 3 - CLI command implementation
4. **Long-term:** Phase 4 - Integration testing and documentation

## Issues and Blockers

**Current Issues:** None identified

**Potential Blockers:**
- Complex services may require more time than estimated
- Legacy code dependencies may need refactoring
- Testing infrastructure may need updates

**Mitigation:**
- Conservative time estimates included
- Migration guide provides troubleshooting
- Templates reduce complexity
