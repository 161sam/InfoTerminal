# Documentation Style Guide

English is the primary language for all documentation.

---

## Language
- Write all main content in English.
- German may be added as an optional appendix under a `DE Notes` section separated by `---`.

## Tone
- Use a concise, imperative style, especially in runbooks.

## Markdown Conventions
- Use `#`-style headings with a blank line after.
- Fenced code blocks with language identifiers.
- Tables should use pipes and alignments.
- Wrap lines at 120 characters when possible.
