# ADR 0002: Multi-Storage Pattern
Date: 2025-09-02
## Status
Accepted
## Context
Different workloads require search, graph traversal and transactional storage.
## Decision
Use OpenSearch for full-text search, Neo4j for graph relations and PostgreSQL for transactional data.
## Consequences
Best-of-breed storage for each workload but increases operational overhead and data consistency challenges.
## Alternatives
- Single relational database
- Vendor-specific multi-model database
