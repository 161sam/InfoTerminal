# Superset Analytics

- TODO: Helm values for OIDC via oauth2-proxy
- Preset job example in k8s manifests (pending)
- Investigation Timeline (minimal)

You can import a simple CSV with events and timestamps to build a timeline dashboard.

1. Upload CSV `infra/analytics/timeline_events.csv` as a dataset
2. Create a Time-series or Event chart; set time column and category
3. Save to a dashboard (e.g., "Investigation Timeline")
