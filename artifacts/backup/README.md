# Backup Artefacts

This directory stores timestamped backups generated by `scripts/backup.sh` and
validation outputs from `tests/backup_restore_synthetic.sh`.

Each backup run creates a sub-directory named after the timestamp that contains
service-specific files and a `backup-manifest.json` linking the services to
individual artefacts.

```

Synthetic test runs append a `synthetic-validation.json` file documenting row
counts per store and the OpenSearch sample document, enabling quick consistency
checks without rerunning the workflow.
