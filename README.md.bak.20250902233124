## Purpose
InfoTerminal stitches together search, graph and analytics services to explore heterogeneous data. The platform runs on Kubernetes and is optimized for local development. See the [developer docs](docs/dev/README.md) for details on architecture and components.

## Prerequisites
- Docker 24+
- Kubernetes / Kind 0.20+
- Helm 3+
- pnpm 8+

make seed-demo      # demo data into search/graph
```

## Health Checks
